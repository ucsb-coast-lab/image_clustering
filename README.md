### Image Clustering

This is a program uses a clustering algorithm to group pixels into a provided number of clusters. A raw image is supplied as a command-line argument, which writes to an output directory which is specified in `main.rs`. The current clustering implementation is primarily based on a color-only k-means algorithm.

```
$ cargo run --release pictures/kelp.jpg
```

A sample of the pre- and post-processed images can be found below, for kelp growing on a longline.
